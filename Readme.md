Diabetes mellitus is characterized by high blood glucose levels. Millions of individuals around the globe suffer from
this chronic, lifelong disease [1]. It has the potential to lead to serious health issues like heart disease, stroke, renal
failure, blindness, and neurological damage. The traditional approach to diagnose and manage diabetes has been to rely
on self-monitoring of blood glucose levels and to adjust medication based on the results. However, this approach is
time consuming, costly, and often unreliable. In the United States[1], approximately 37.3 million individuals, or 11%
of the community, have diabetes. 90% to 95% of all instances of diabetes are type 2, making it the most prevalent type.
Diabetes affects 537 million people worldwide. According to estimates, this amount will rise to 643 million by 2030
and 783 million by 2045. Diabetes mortality rates increased by 3% between 2000 and 2019
